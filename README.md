# Variable length bit vectors in C

Simple bit vectors in C, with the usual create, delete, get, set, clear and length operations. This implementation *does not* automatically extend the bit 
vector if you go past the end, but that is a simple addition.

For some reason, students these days struggle with the ideas of bits and numbers in bases other than 10. Variable length strings of bits is one of the things
that gives them a difficult time. But once they realize their utility, they are pleased.
